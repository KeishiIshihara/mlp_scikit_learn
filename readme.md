# MLP classification with Sklearn

This repository is made for myself to better understand scikit-learn, scikit-neuralnetwork and multi-layer perceptron.

## train.py
- sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier

## train_sknn.py
- sknn.mlp.Classifier
- executes one hidden layer with (5,10,..,30) nodes
- outputs result fig of training
